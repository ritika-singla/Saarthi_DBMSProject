# Saarthi_DBMSProject

Need of the Project: 
Hiring domestic help has always been a hassle. The helpers as well as labor are always distributed and scattered. There is no such platform which can serve as a one stop solution to all of one’s domestic help needs. This is where Saarthi will revolutionise the industry.
 
Objectives of the Project:
The project provides space where workers( labor, electricians, mechanics, network experts etc.) can find work on daily/monthly basis, and customers can find helpers for regular tasks. For eg. If you want to hire someone to paint your home,you can find, or if you need an electrician, and the city is unknown to you, our project will help you.
